# MathPhysChemLab

## Introduction

MathPhysChemLab is a powerful, pure front-end Web-APP designed to enhance learning and teaching in mathematics, physics, and chemistry. Our platform is tailored for both students and teachers, offering an advanced question generator that covers topics from elementary school to college entry levels.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Question Generator:** Generate 90% of the questions randomly with no reliance on a pre-existing question bank. Our models offer thousands of adjustable parameters, allowing teachers to generate highly specific questions. With this system, tens of thousands of unique questions can be generated per second, supporting rapid assignment creation and PDF export.
- **Educational Tools:** Includes a variety of calculators and simulators, such as matrix calculators, n-dimensional equation solvers, acceleration calculators, and celestial body motion models.

## Project Scope

- **Codebase:** Over 30,000 lines of code.
- **Team Members:** 2 developers. (over 9+ hours per day)
- **Development Time:** 2 months. (over 500 hours)

## Technologies

- **HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript**: Core technologies for structure, styling, and interactivity.
- **KaTeX**: For rendering complex mathematical expressions.
- **Web APIs**: For file handling, storage, and more.
